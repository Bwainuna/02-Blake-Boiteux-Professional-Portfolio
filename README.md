Module 2 Challenge - Professional Portfolio.

User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

Note* Links associated with the images on the webpages will lead to google.com as will all the contact links, as their pages have not been set up yet. The only link that will take you to an actual complete page I've worked on will be Image link 1 leading to the Module 1 project.

Sources that were used during this assignment came from class in canvas, as well as through some websites containing semantic code elements:

I also used the Module 1 Project as a source of inspiration and reference for this project. The original code (starter code) source for the module one project came from this attached link. I used this mainly to get my code for the nav bar, however I changed some elements to make it unique to my site: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram by Xandromus
